# Large Scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR)
This official repository houses baseline methods, training scripts, and pretrained models for the LUMIR challenge at Learn2Reg 2024.\
The challenge is dedicated to ***unsupervised*** brain MRI image registration and offers a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 preprocessed T1-weighted 3D brain MRI images, available for training, testing, and validation purposes.

Please visit [https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/](https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/) for more information.

## Dataset: 
- ***Download Training Dataset:*** Access the training dataset via Google Drive ([~52GB](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1PTHAX9hZX7HBXXUGVvI1ar1LUf4aVbq9)).
- ***Preprocessing:*** The OpenBHB dataset underwent initial preprocessing by its creators, which included skull stripping and affine registration. For comprehensive details, refer to the [OpenBHB GitHub](https://baobablab.github.io/bhb/dataset) page and their [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922007522). Subsequently, we performed N4 bias correction with ITK and intensity normalization using a [pre-existing tool](https://github.com/jcreinhold/intensity-normalization).
- ***Annotation:*** We conducted segmentation of the anatomical structures using automated software. To enhance the dataset for evaluation purposes, an experienced radiologist and neurologist contributed manual landmark annotations to a subset of the images.
- ***Image size:*** The dimensions of each image are `160 x 224 x 192`.
- ***Normalization:*** Intensity values for each image volume have been normalized to fall within the range `[0,255]`.
- ***Dataset structure:***
