# Large Scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR)
This official repository houses baseline methods, training scripts, and pretrained models for the LUMIR challenge at Learn2Reg 2024.\ 
The challenge is dedicated to ***unsupervised*** brain MRI image registration and offers a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 preprocessed T1-weighted 3D brain MRI images, available for training, testing, and validation purposes.

### Baseline methods:
1. VFA
2. TransMorph
3. VoxelMorph
5. DeedsBCV

### Evaluation metrics:
1. TRE
2. Dice
3. Non-diffeomorphic volumes

### Dataset: 
Training dataset
