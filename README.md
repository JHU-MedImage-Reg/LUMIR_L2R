# Large Scale Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR)
This official repository houses baseline methods, training scripts, and pretrained models for the LUMIR challenge at Learn2Reg 2024.\
The challenge is dedicated to ***unsupervised*** brain MRI image registration and offers a comprehensive dataset of over 4000 preprocessed T1-weighted 3D brain MRI images, available for training, testing, and validation purposes.

Please visit [https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/](https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/) for more information.

### Dataset: 
Training dataset
- ***Preprocessing:*** The OpenBHB dataset was first preprocessed, including skull-stripping and affine registration, by the dataset creators. For details, please see [OpenBHB GitHub](https://baobablab.github.io/bhb/dataset) page and their [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922007522). We then applied N4 bias correction using ITK and intensity normalization using a [pre-existing tool](https://github.com/jcreinhold/intensity-normalization). 
- ***Image size:*** Each image and label map has a size of `160 x 192 x 224`.
- ***Normalization:*** The intensity values of each image volume are normalized into a range `[0,1]`.
- ***Dataset structure:***
    ```bash
    LUMIR_data/Train/------
            subject_0001.nii.gz   <--- a brain T1 MR image
            subject_0002.nii.gz
